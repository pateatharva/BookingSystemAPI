# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- Workspace targets .NET 10 Razor Pages; prefers Clean Architecture with Repository and Service layers for Booking Management System using MongoDB.Driver.
- Implement code changes directly by producing complete file contents for workspace updates (not just instructions). This allows for implementation-ready edits that can overwrite local files.
